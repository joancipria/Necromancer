# Necromancer
A free, open source and multiplatform cards game inspired by Spectromancer, Magic: The Gathering, and the like. Build in web technologies such as HTML5, JS and CSS in top of NW.js.

:exclamation: **Attention** This is an early experimental version of the game, and still has several bugs and missing features. Just for testing since it is not playable yet (maybe in a  few months?).

### Features
  - Play singleplayer duels
  - With more than 20 different cards (of 4 different elemental types)
  - Very basic AI implementation for testing battle system
